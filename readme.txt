Easily add cross browser "Scroll to Top" button to your website. It will be responsive and compatible with all major browsers. It will work with any theme!


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to add a "Scroll to Top" button to your website in a simple and elegant way. This button appears at the bottom-right of the website once the visitors scrolls down a page on your website. It appears only when visitors scroll down the webpage. As a result, your website visitors can easily scroll smoothly back to the very top of a page with one click of the button. This can be particularly handy for pages with a lot of text/content, or in cases wherever a browser's scrollbar is just not good enough (or not present at all, like on tablets) to enable one-click, one-screen scrolling. This gives your website better navigation and also adds a more professional look to your website.

This plugin give you finer control over "Scroll to Top" button, it can be configured on the plugin settings page. You can select where the button will be showed, such as home page or all pages. You can customize the button style using and combining 10 symbols and 4 backgrounds from FontAwesome library, in result you have 40 variations of buttons. You can change the size of button, color (unlimited) of background, color (unlimited) of symbol and etc. If you want more options then tell us and we will be happy to add it.

Also you don't need to edit any file of your theme, this plugin will do everything for you. It's just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start enjoying the Scroll To Up button. "Scroll to Top" button will be responsive and compatible with all major browsers. It will work with any theme! No knowledge of any coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) is required at all.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. The POT file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Just send the PO file to us at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and we will include this translation within the next plugin update. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy your fancy "Scroll to Top" button. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WP Admin Panel`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Scroll to Top`".

= Q. Is it possible to use different buttons/arrows? =
A. This plugin comes with the FontAwesome iconic font. Now you can customize the button style using and combining 10 symbols and 4 backgrounds from FontAwesome library, in result you have 40 variations of buttons. You can change the size of button, color (unlimited) of background, color (unlimited) of symbol and etc. A future version may include more buttons, and/or the option to upload your own button graphics.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Panel of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing the website of the creator that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Please visit the [Dedicated Plugin Page on GitHub](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/simple-scroll-to-top-button) and report.

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
A. Any suggestions are very welcome! Please send us an email to [arthurgareginyan@gmail.com](mailto:arthurgareginyan@gmail.com). Thank you!

= Q. I love this plugin! Can I help somehow? =
A. Yes, any financial contributions are welcome! Just visit [the website of the creator](https://www.arthurgareginyan.com/donate.html), click on the donate button, and thank you!
